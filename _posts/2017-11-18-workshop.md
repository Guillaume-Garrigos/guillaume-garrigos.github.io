<p>I was at the workshop "Gradient dynamics, convergence  and related topics"  organized by <a href="https://www.tse-fr.eu/people/jerome-bolte?tab=publications">Jérome Bolte</a> and <a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/sylvain.sorin">Sylvain Sorin</a> at Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris. I gave a talk intitled "Quadratic functions in Hilbert spaces: Lojasiewicz inequality and Sobolev regularity", based on the work done in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09477">this paper</a> (see Section 5.1).</p>
