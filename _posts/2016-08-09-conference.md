<p>I attended the <a href="http://www.iccopt2016.tokyo/">ICCOPT</a> conference in Tokyo (Japan). 
I gave there a talk about how the geometry of a function determine the convergence rates of descent methods (find the slides <a href="pdf/2016_ICCOPT">here</a>).
It is based on a previous <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-014-0642-3">paper</a> and a forthcoming one.</p>
