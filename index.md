I am  Maître de Conférences at the [Université Paris 7 Diderot](https://universite.univ-paris-diderot.fr/), member of the [Laboratoire de Probabilités, Statistique et Modélisation](https://www.lpsm.paris/) (Team [Statistique, données, algorithmes](https://www.lpsm.paris/recherche/les-equipes/%C3%A9quipe-statistique/)).

Formerly, I used to be a postdoc researcher at the [École Normale Supérieure](http://www.ens.fr/) ([DMA](http://www.math.ens.fr/)), member of the [NORIA](http://www.gpeyre.com/noria/) (Numerical Optimal tRansport for ImAging) research group.
Before that, I had a two-years postdoc position at the [Laboratory for Computational and Statistical Learning](http://lcsl.mit.edu), a joint lab between the [IIT](https://www.iit.it/it/home) and [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/).
Even before that I did a PhD in Optimization between the [Université de Montpellier](http://www.umontpellier.fr/) and the [Universidad Santa Maria](http://www.usm.cl/) in Valparaiso, Chile.
	       
My research essentially focuses on dynamical systems associated to optimization problems. 
In particular, I am interested in algorithms and regularization methods for nonsmooth (eventually nonconvex) problems arising in signal/image processing and machine learning. 
I am particularly interested in the interplay between the modelization of a learning/inverse problem as an optimization problem, and its resolution. 
My papers are [here](/research).
