I am  Maître de Conférences at the [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/) (formerly Université de Paris, or Paris-Diderot, or Paris-7), member of the [Laboratoire de Probabilités, Statistique et Modélisation](https://www.lpsm.paris/), in the Team [Statistique, données, algorithmes](https://www.lpsm.paris/recherche/les-equipes/%C3%A9quipe-statistique/).
	       
My research essentially focuses on dynamical systems associated to optimization problems. 
In particular, I am interested in algorithms and regularization methods for nonsmooth (eventually nonconvex) problems arising in machine learning and signal or image processing. 
I am particularly interested in the interplay between the modeling of a learning/inverse problem as an optimization problem, and its resolution.
